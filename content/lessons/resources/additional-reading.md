### Articles:

- [Faux-SQL or NoSQL? Examining four DynamoDB Patterns in Serverless Applications](https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/dynamodb-patterns-serverless/) - This is a post I wrote on the common data modeling patterns I see with DynamoDB in serverless applications.
- [Why Amazon DynamoDB isn't for everyone](https://read.acloud.guru/why-amazon-dynamodb-isnt-for-everyone-and-how-to-decide-when-it-s-for-you-aefc52ea9476) - My favorite post on this topic. Forrest Brazeal does a great job breaking down the pros and cons of DynamoDB.

### Videos:

- [Advanced Design Patterns for DynamoDB (reInvent 2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzeKPKpucS0). Rick Houlihan is a master of DynamoDB and has some great tips.
- [Advanced Design Pattens for DynamoDB (reInvent 2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaEPXoXVf2k). Rick Houlihan is back with more tips. The first half is similar to 2017, but the second half has different examples. Highly recommended.

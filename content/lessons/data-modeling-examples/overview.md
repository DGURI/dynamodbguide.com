This chapter includes a number of case studies, each exploring a way to model data in DynamoDB for a particular scenario. Sometimes, seeing a single example is better than reading pages of documentation.

This chapter is intended to grow over time. Are there particular use cases you'd like to see? [Hit me up](mailto:alexdebrie1@gmail.com) and let me know!

Available & planned examples:

- Scaling write bottlenecks* (Coming soon!)
- Time-based workflows* (Coming soon!)
- Enum attributes* (Coming soon!)
- Working with large items* (Coming soon!)
- ACID transactions* (Coming soon!)
- Geo-hashing* (Coming soon!)
- [Hierarchical data*](./hierarchical-data)
- Graph queries and adjacency lists* (Coming soon!)
